<strong>Important Note:</strong> ACF Blocks is built on-top of Advanced Custom Fields Pro. This plugin requires ACF Pro to function. Make sure you have ACF Pro installed and activated.

## Template and Pattern Library

ACF Blocks Suite now includes access to the Extendify template and pattern library that can be accessed by clicking the "Library" button in the menu bar of the editor. We provide a variety of templates and patterns to serve different use cases and are adding more templates every week.

Note: Templates and patterns rely on blocks and styling applied by the Editor Plus plugin. The Editor Plus plugin is required when importing a template or pattern. If you uninstall Editor Plus, the templates and patterns will still display on your site, but the styling may be affected. Additionally, stock images included in the templates are hosted on GutenbergHub.com. We recommend replacing the images or adding them to your media library directly.

## Privacy

ACF Blocks Suite uses a custom API to fetch templates and patterns from the Extendify template and pattern library. To improve the service and stability we store logs which may contain the following:

* browser type
* referring site
* date and time of request
* category selection or search term
* anonymized IP address

API requests are only made when a user clicks on the Library button.
